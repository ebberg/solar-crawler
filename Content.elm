## Dī Penātēs Solar Crawler

Humans, or what have become of humans after the exodus from climate-ravaged
Earth, began to learn to think in longer timelines, as the centuries inched
past, and Martian terraforming colonies, Venusian cloud cities, and Ceresian
mining operations took root.

This was in part because lifespan was so theoretically expandable, yet so
fragile.

Cyborgs need to sync their sense of time and perspective to communicate with
each other. Something in their mechanics, and their networked spread past the
limits of body, unmoored the cyborg from time.

This allows cyborgs a fast-forward button on their life. To dissociate


### The 26th C Solar System

A previous generation of cyborgs built a Space Elevator on Earth, now known as
Terra, the planet blanketed by resource-stripping drones. Resources sent up the

off-world, sometimes to Venusian cloud cities, sometimes to Martian terraforming
communities.

## The 26th C Solar System

The 26th Century Solar System still starts with the planet formerly known as
Earth. Terra, the third planet from the sun, has been outfitted with a Space
Elevator. Robots are mining the planet for resourcs to be shipped off-world.

There are cloud-cities in the atmosphere of Venus, thought to be the future
direction of civilization.

There is a terraforming society underway in Mars, complete with underground
tunnel systems.

There is an astroid mining operation on Ceres.

The Solar Crawler is unique as the largest freighter/cruiser in the solar
system. It has a population in the low thousands, but could accomodate hundreds
of


## The Captain's Mission

The Captain's Mission is to deliver an ice shipment from Ceres to Venus, and
payment back to Ceres.

## The Smuggler's Scheme

The Smuggler is trying to make four drop-offs: at Mars, at Terra, at Venus, and
finally at Ceres.

## The Officers' Plot

The Officers are plotting to overthrow the Captain and First Mate, installing
the Security Officer as the captain. They want to deliver the ice to the
Revolutionaries on Terra, who plan to retrofit the Solar Crawler as an
Interstellar Crawler, and find a new home across the stars.

## The Scientist's Revolution

The Scientist is trying to help their community on Terra, who are building
a warp drive to retrofit onto the Solar Crawler, and escape the solar system to
travel the stars.

## The Feelers and the End of the Revolutionaries

The Feelers are searching for the Scientist and the Smuggler. They thought that
the target was the Navigation Officer and the Security Officer, but they have
corrected themselves, and are now scanning the group for the correct targets.
